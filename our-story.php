                <article>After the European economic crisis, I came up with the idea of exploiting their openness to the GCC market. In addition to strengthen my presence in the country that still maintains sprit of the past "Andalusia and contemporary of Europe"..</article>
                <p>I already traveled in April of 2012, to attend the National Gallery of Food and Beverage, where I stayed in Eurostar hotel that overlooking to the tranquility green capital city of Madrid which holding the best minds, architecture, manufacturing, education, tourism and hospitality in Europe.</p>
                <p>The day before the gallery, I went shopping in outlet Las Rozas Village, which is about 20 km far from Madrid. In the end pleasant corridor I saw a cafe-restaurant called concept lobby cafe, I impressed by the spirit of the place, and the taste was integrated with the elegance of the decor.</p>
                <p>As soon as I asked to meet with the manager “Mr. Federico”. Later known, he is one of
    the brightest minds on the field of food and beverages in Europe he owns 17
    restaurant. I also know that he has partners, Mr. Benjamin one of the most intelligent personalities in Madrid, also he own restaurants chain, As well as Mr. Ramon the President of the jeunes Restaurateurs d Europe &amp; owns one of the largest restaurants in Madrid.</p>
                <p>I offered him to reproduce that restaurant in Saudi Arabia, and I remember that I told him it is advisable to agree with me now, before I put you in competition with other agent in the National Gallery of F&amp;B tomorrow, He surprised me when he said no! no!, am the one who will take you to the National Gallery of F&amp;B tomorrow, he was confident that I would not find a company specializing in the planning, design, implementation, management and operation of restaurants in Spain like their company, with the rest of his partners.</p>
                <p>It turns out that they are the best, and what you see around of new spirit which derived from Granada civilization is a result of diligent work lasted for two years in order to satisfy our visitors in a quite &amp; Privacy atmosphere which allowing them to spend their work and communicate with others in a peaceful time..</p>
