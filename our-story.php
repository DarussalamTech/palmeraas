                <!--<article>After the European economic crisis, I came up with the idea of exploiting their openness to the GCC market. In addition to strengthen my presence in the country that still maintains sprit of the past "Andalusia and contemporary of Europe"..</article>-->
                <article>In April of 2012, in the wake of the financial crisis in Europe, I came up with the idea of exploiting the opportunity for Spain to open up to the GCC markets. I felt that this would promote my cultural presence in a country that has the spirit of the past, &quot;Al-Andalus&quot; , as well as more contemporary aspects of modern Europe.</article>
                <p>With this as my mission, I traveled to Spain to attend the international exhibition for food and beverage and I stayed at the Eurostar Madrid Towers with its exquisite view of the green and serene Madrid. Spain is, and has been home to some of Europe&acute;s best thinkers, and continues to play an important role in the field&acute;s of architecture, manufacturing, education, tourism and hospitality.</p>
                <p>The day before the exhibition I went shopping at a market &quot;Las Rozas Village&quot; - around 20 kilometers from Madrid. After my last promenade, I sat down in the Lobby Caf&eacute; and restaurant. I really liked the spirit of the place, its &quot;Concept&quot; , as well as the integration of the flavors with the place; the elegance of the d&eacute;cor; and the smoothly run organization. It had quite the impact on me. I then asked to meet with the administrator.</p>
                <p>Mr. Federico, turned out to be one of the brightest minds of Europe in the food and beverage and owns 17 Restaurants. I immediately listened to my intuition based on my experience and gave him an offer.</p>
                <p>I said to him: &quot;I will offer you to clone this great restaurant of yours and have it moved to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.&quot;</p> 
				<p>To which I quickly added, &quot;it is better for you to agree with me now than to show up tomorrow at the exhibition. For by then I will have your restaurant in competition with other restaurant&quot;</p>
				<p>Frederico was quick and relied &quot;no .. no .. I will take you to the Exhibition at ten in the morning myself!&quot;</p>
 				<p>I was surprised at the answer thinking he would agree immediately. He then continued &quot;... I challenge you to find a company that specializes in planning, design, implementation, management and operation of restaurants in Spain with the rest of my partners! My partners are Mr. Benjamin, one of the smartest characters in Madrid. He is ultra-elegant and has a chain of great restaurants. Also Mr. Ramon who does not just have great charisma but also excellent leadership characteristics and is currently the president of the young chefs Federation in Europe and owns one of the largest Restaurants in Madrid.&quot;</p>
				<p>Of course they won the bet!</p>
				<p>And the result now surrounds you. This is the new spirit of the &quot;Concept&quot; I chanced upon in Spain. It is inspired by Granada Architecture, and is the product of more than two years of hard work by the team. The Spanish team members have visited us on numerous occasions to assist us in ensuring that we perfectly introduce the &quot;Concept&quot; , its flavors and ambiance to Riyadh and its inhabitants. This is important to me so that our guests can experience the same as I did: the warmth of the place the delicious dishes all while enjoying an excellent service.</p>
